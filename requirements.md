# Requirements

This document defines the actual requirements that the Orbis ecosystem addresses - the problems it solves and needs it fulfills, rather than the features that implement those solutions.

## Orbis

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. Technical Support Assistance
- **REQ-ORB-1.1**: Support engineers need intelligent assistance when analyzing technical issues
- **REQ-ORB-1.2**: Support engineers need to analyze Azure DevOps tickets or text questions
- **REQ-ORB-1.3**: Engineers need contextual answers to technical questions about issues, errors, and configuration
- **REQ-ORB-1.4**: Engineers need to request assistance through familiar workflows (Azure DevOps tagging, Teams Bot)
- **REQ-ORB-1.5**: Engineers need automatic responses with relevant documentation references and recommendations

#### 2. Multi-Project Context Management
- **REQ-ORB-2.1**: Engineers need to work with multiple independent projects without cross-contamination of information
- **REQ-ORB-2.2**: Responses must only include information relevant to the specific project being analyzed, or generic information if not specific to a project in particular
- **REQ-ORB-2.3**: The system needs to determine project context(or lack thereof) automatically from ticket metadata
- **REQ-ORB-2.4**: Documentation must be scoped to appropriate projects for accurate context

#### 3. Heterogeneous Knowledge Base Access
- **REQ-ORB-3.1**: Engineers need to search across multiple documentation types (data source types) simultaneously without manual aggregation
- **REQ-ORB-3.2**: The system needs to access data source types (such as work items, wikis, html pages...) as a unified knowledge base
- **REQ-ORB-3.3**: Different content structures must be handled transparently
- **REQ-ORB-3.4**: Results need relevance ranking across different source types

#### 4. Appropriate and Relevant Responses
- **REQ-ORB-4.1**: Engineers need answers appropriate to their problem type (troubleshooting, configuration, installation, etc.)
- **REQ-ORB-4.2**: Engineers need responses drawing from the most relevant documentation sources for their question
- **REQ-ORB-4.3**: Engineers need confidence indicators on analysis reliability

#### 5. Automated Documentation Synthesis
- **REQ-ORB-5.1**: Engineers need comprehensive summaries synthesized from multiple sources
- **REQ-ORB-5.2**: Responses need granular source references with hyperlinks or exact titles for verification and trust
- **REQ-ORB-5.3**: Summaries must be actionable and specific to the question

#### 6. Data Synchronization and Freshness
- **REQ-ORB-6.1**: The knowledge base needs regular synchronization with data source types
- **REQ-ORB-6.2**: Only changed data should be re-ingested to minimize processing
- **REQ-ORB-6.3**: The system needs to track ingestion state and timestamps
- **REQ-ORB-6.4**: Urgent updates need manual refresh capability

#### 7. Extensibility for New Data Sources
- **REQ-ORB-7.1**: New documentation sources (data source types) must be addable by adding a connector (plugin) and modifying not more than 3 code files in total
- **REQ-ORB-7.2**: Templates or classes must be available to facilitate the creation of new data source types plugins/connectors
- **REQ-ORB-7.3**: A data source types can be instantiated into a data source instance with a single YAML file
- **REQ-ORB-7.4**: Different authentication methods must be supported for different systems
- **REQ-ORB-7.5**: New sources need automatic integration with existing search and analysis
- **REQ-ORB-7.6**: New sources need automatic integration with ingestion and embedding in an elegant way

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 8. Performance and Responsiveness
- **REQ-ORB-8.1**: Analysis must complete within reasonable time for interactive use (target: <30 seconds)
- **REQ-ORB-8.2**: Multiple concurrent support requests must be handled without degradation

## Orbis-Search

### Functional Requirements

#### 9. Azure DevOps Ticket Discovery
- **REQ-SRCH-9.1**: Engineers need to find relevant Azure DevOps tickets quickly
- **REQ-SRCH-9.2**: Search must surface tickets based on semantic similarity and keyword matching
- **REQ-SRCH-9.3**: Multiple search strategies need to be combined for better recall and precision
- **REQ-SRCH-9.4**: Results need ranking that balances different search methods effectively

#### 10. Historical Context Retrieval
- **REQ-SRCH-10.1**: Engineers need to discover how similar problems were solved previously
- **REQ-SRCH-10.2**: Search must identify tickets with similar symptoms or error patterns
- **REQ-SRCH-10.3**: The system needs to surface resolutions and workarounds from past tickets

#### 11. Search Result Synthesis
- **REQ-SRCH-11.1**: Engineers need synthesized summaries of multiple similar tickets found in search results
- **REQ-SRCH-11.2**: Summaries must highlight common patterns and solutions across multiple tickets
- **REQ-SRCH-11.3**: The system needs to provide context on how different tickets relate to each other

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 12. Search Performance
- **REQ-SRCH-12.1**: Search queries must return results quickly (target: <500ms)
- **REQ-SRCH-12.2**: The system needs to handle large ticket repositories efficiently
